[SaVaGe Maps](https://savagemaps.com) is where I host my [D3](https://d3js.org)-fueled map exploits. I figured it was finally time to curate a single map resource for future me since most of my side projects go unpublished or end up in an all-too-cliché "private" repo.

Make sure to check out the [Resources](#resources) section of the README for a list of all the different sites, docs, and people that I found useful when trying to put these maps together.

Thanks for checking out the Savage Maps repo. Hopefully, this project helps you build some Savage maps of your own!
